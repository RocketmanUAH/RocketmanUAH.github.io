    <h1>Biography</h1> 
        <br>
    <p> My legend dates back to the twelfth century you see. It began on a midsummers day with the sun blazing overhead. No, wait. It was a blustery Autumn day. I was the unsavory fellow back when it all started. Which was in the winter as I recall. I remember the tough crowd, all the hot babes fought over me that summer. Yes. Yes that’s right, it was summer. A scorching midsummer day. I was a dangerous man at the time. And yet, refined somehow. Everyone thought so. They still think so to this day. Although, maybe they didn’t think so as much back then. But they definitely said I was dangerous, I’m sure of it…And I know I’ve always been refined so they must have been thinking it. Yes. Yes indeed. Everyone thought and said and talked about how amazing I was. I’m still amazing of course, but no longer the bad boy I was back then. On that chilled, frozen winter day. Why my legend actually began on the same day as today, a Tuesday or a Wednesday. Or a Saturday, perhaps. No it was on Monday, though I suppose it could have been a Tuesday or Wednesday. Thursday is a distinct possibility or Friday even. Although Monday does sound right, and Saturday is a lovely day to begin a legend, perhaps it was a Thursday. Or Tuesday, maybe Wenesday or Friday? There's always Monday, too. And Saturday, can't forget Saturday. No, no, it was almost certainly on a ..., anyway I will continue the re-telling of my legend; But first, there will be a five minute break. Stand still and await my return. </p>
